## FAQ

#### Question 1
Difference between Flex and Grid in CSS

Flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column. 
Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time.

#### Question 2
What does Zuri do?

They offer highly subsidised tech trainings thanks to their Partners.
They give basic introduction to software development and design aimed at complete beginners like me :)
